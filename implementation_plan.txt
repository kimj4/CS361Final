===== implementation plans going forward

AHNI developer suggests that we extend

    com.ojcoleman.ahni.evaluation.HyperNEATFitnessFunction
    com.ojcoleman.ahni.evaluation.HyperNEATTargetFitnessFunction

To create our new project. We will most likely extend the first since the second
seems to be for when we have training data.

There are many examples included in the repository but author suggests that we
look at

    com.ojcoleman.ahni.experiments.TestTargetFitnessFunction
    com.ojcoleman.ahni.experiments.objectrecognition

Again, we should look at the second since we don't have any training data.



A problem we run into with using coevolution is having access two evolving
populations in 'evaluate(...)' in our extension of HyperNEATFitnessFunction.

We may need to alter some deep part of the code in order to allow coevolution.

We may be able to get an effective coevolution when we separate the one
population into two groups that have separate selection
